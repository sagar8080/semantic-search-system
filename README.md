# Business Context
Congressman Larson's office seeks to design a system architecture for processing and organizing digital documents to enable intelligent indexing and search by keyword and topic. 

Traditional document management approaches lack the sophistication to meet the evolving information needs of the Congressman, his staff, and constituents. This project aims to augment those approaches by incorporating natural language processing (NLP) techniques for intelligent records management. 

The scope includes conducting stakeholder interviews, assessing existing digital and physical records, researching the Congressman's service history, and ultimately delivering a comprehensive system and information architecture

# Solution Proposal

### A Semantic Document Processing and Intelligent Search System

In today‚Äôs digital world, organizations often have vast amounts of documents‚Äîemails, reports, memos, scanned files‚Äîscattered across different locations and formats. Searching through them to find the right information can be like finding a needle in a haystack. Congressman Larson's office, like many others, faces this challenge and is seeking a smarter way to manage and access important documents.

Our solution is to build an intelligent document processing system. This system won‚Äôt just store files‚Äîit will understand them. By using natural language processing (NLP), we can automatically read documents, tag them with meaningful topics, and make them easily searchable by keyword, theme, or even people and places mentioned. Think of it as giving the Congressman's office a digital assistant that can read and organize files intelligently.

### üîç Deep Dive into the Architecture

The proposed system architecture consists of multiple components working together to ingest, process, understand, store, and retrieve documents intelligently. Here‚Äôs how it works:

#### 1. **Document Ingestion Layer**
   - **Sources**: Digital documents are ingested from multiple formats and sources, including PDFs, Word files, scanned documents, and emails.
   - **Preprocessing**: This layer performs file format conversion, optical character recognition (OCR) for scanned content, and basic metadata extraction (author, date, file type, etc.).

#### 2. **Data Lake / Storage Layer**
   - **Cloud-based Repository**: All raw and processed documents are stored in a centralized data lake (e.g., AWS S3 or GCP Storage). It serves as a scalable and secure foundation for further processing.
   - **Metadata Index**: Stores metadata extracted during ingestion for fast lookup and traceability.

#### 3. **Semantic Processing Layer**
   - **NLP Pipeline**: Here, the core intelligence happens. Using NLP models and LLM's, the system extracts:
     - Named Entities (people, organizations, dates)
     - Topics and key phrases
     - Summary of the content
   - **Taxonomy Mapping**: Documents are mapped to a predefined or dynamically generated taxonomy (e.g., legislative issues, constituents' concerns).

#### 4. **Knowledge Graph (Advanced)**
   - **Entity Linking**: Constructs relationships between extracted entities to build a knowledge graph (e.g., who sent what to whom, about which topic).
   - Enhances contextual understanding and advanced query capability.

#### 5. **Search and Query Interface**
   - **Semantic Search Engine**: Powered by vector search using Elasticsearch with KNN vector and Titan embeddings, this component allows users to search not just by keywords, but by meaning.
   - **Faceted Browsing**: Allows filtering results by category, date range, person involved, or topic.
   - **User Interface**: A clean, intuitive dashboard for staffers and researchers to query the system, preview documents, and track topics of interest.

#### 6. **Governance, Access Control & Security (Advanced)**
   - **Role-based Access**: Ensures sensitive information is accessible only to authorized personnel.
   - **Audit Logging**: Maintains an access trail for compliance and transparency.
